# Building AI Applications With Haystack

This repository contains the **notebooks and hands-on materials** for the course **"Building AI Applications With Haystack"**, provided by **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)** in collaboration with **[Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/)**.

The course teaches you how to use **Haystack**, an open-source framework, to build powerful **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines**, intelligent agents, and custom AI applications.

## üìö Course Topics

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Haystack Building Blocks

In this lesson, you‚Äôll explore the **fundamental building blocks** of Haystack:

* **Components** ‚Äì the modular units of computation (retrievers, readers, generators, etc.).
* **Running Components Individually** ‚Äì test each piece before combining.
* **Combining Components** ‚Äì link them together to form data flows.
* **Pipelines** ‚Äì construct workflows for different AI tasks.
* **Document Search Pipeline** ‚Äì build your first simple search system.

This provides a solid foundation for understanding how **everything in Haystack fits together**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Build Customized RAG

Here, you‚Äôll go beyond the basics and **create your own Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline**:

* Combine retrievers, readers, and LLMs into a **RAG workflow**.
* Customize the **behavior of RAG** (e.g., change how many documents to retrieve, tweak prompts).
* Understand how to **adapt RAG to different tasks**, such as answering factual questions or summarizing documents.

By the end, you‚Äôll be comfortable designing **tailored RAG pipelines** for your own applications.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Components ‚Äì News Summarizer

This lab shows you how to **extend Haystack** by writing custom components:

* Build your **own custom component** in Python.
* Create a **News Summarizer component** that condenses long news articles into short, useful summaries.
* Integrate your custom component into a pipeline, mixing it with existing Haystack modules.

You‚Äôll learn how to **go beyond out-of-the-box features** and craft components for **specialized use cases**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fallback with Branching Pipeline

Sometimes AI systems **fail or produce empty results**.
In this lesson, you‚Äôll learn to handle that gracefully:

* Use **branching pipelines** to add decision points.
* Implement **fallback logic** (e.g., if a retriever fails, fall back to a different one).
* Improve system reliability by **ensuring robust outputs even in edge cases**.

This prepares you for **real-world scenarios** where robustness is essential.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Self-Reflecting Agents with Loops

Agents can **think about their own outputs and refine them**.
In this lesson, you‚Äôll build **self-reflecting agents**:

* Implement **feedback loops** where the agent checks its own answers.
* Learn how looping helps **reduce hallucinations** and **improve accuracy**.
* Explore **advanced agent workflows** for complex tasks.

This introduces a **more autonomous and intelligent way of building AI agents**.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Chat Agent with Function Calling

Finally, you‚Äôll bring everything together by building an **interactive AI agent**:

* Create a **chat agent** that can have back-and-forth conversations.
* Use **function calling** to let the agent **trigger tools** (like search, summarization, or APIs).
* Build an AI that doesn‚Äôt just answer questions, but can **act dynamically**.

This is the **capstone skill** for building **real AI assistants** with Haystack.
